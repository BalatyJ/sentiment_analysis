### Sentiment Analysis

Final CS 331 project where I created the functionality for a bayesian network classifier to train from a dataset and use that data to make predictions on test data. sentiment.py vectorizes and cleans the test data, and results.txt stores the results of the test.

Final results and analysis are in Sentiment Analysis Report pdf.
